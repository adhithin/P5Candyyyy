# Summary + Story
You’re a knight from the human realm that’s been held captive by the goblins. After being taken prisoner during the apocalypse, you’ve lost hope of ever seeing your friends again. 
One day, after a guard walks by, you hear the fall of an item. Your eyes shift to the sound. It’s a golden key. You pick it up and curiously fit the key in the lock of your cell. It unlocks the door, and you take a step outside. You let out a deep breath, and look both ways, then revel in your position. 
This is your chance to escape. Type “help” to start. 

In this virtual escape room, the user will be a hero tasked with the goal of escaping from the dungeon. Throughout the game, the user will encounter various puzzles, which they must solve to escape. In addition with these puzzles, the user will be prompted to interact with various characters, such as spirits, goblins, dragons, and other fantasy beings. Data stored here will include 1) leaderboard of those who have played the game 2) data on the characters and 3) data on the puzzles. The purpose of this project is to captivate the user's mind to prompt critical thinking skills and teach them how to apply these skills in fun, fantasy based adventures. Through play, strategies, critical thinking, and even collaboration will be present for the user. 

On our end: 

**Collaboration** 

We'll be collaborating together to create this project, and work on coding each segment of the code, as well as creating the project plan. 
So far, we've all gotten along really well, and have worked well together on formatting our work, designing the game, and developing the gaming concept. 

**Communication** 

We do our communication using Slack and Zoom nearly every day in order to progress on our work. We hope to do the same over winter break. We have also made a group Discord server for extra communication if needed.


**Creativity** 

We're implementing creative game ideas, such as a creative fantasy concept, as well as developing engaging events and aspects to further reach to the user. Creativity is included in character design, game design, as well as conceptual mapping. 


**Critical Thinking** 

We use critical thinking when mapping out our story board for the game, and linking the puzzles together for the user to solve the escape room. We need to use critical thinking to design the game, and make it challenging but also fun for the user. Mainly, the puzzles and being smart with how the puzzles are programmed and solved is the key section where critical thinking will apply.

# Data

**Characters**
- using inspiration from common cartoon characters
- Each NPC can have their own individual data set
  - Data confirms actions 
  - For trading puzzles
- User's Character
  - Character has data to confirm actions
  - Can use characters from other games
    - Have alternate options as data values
    - Optional: Make database for users to input other characters or their own
      - Not main priority
      
**Inventory**
- Inventory has data values
  - Determines what items the player has
  - Keys, Puzzle items, Map

# Delivery Plans/Important Dates
- Tuesdays: test prep
On Tuesdays, we’ll be reviewing what we need to do to prepare for the MC test. We’re going to be reviewing and reflecting on our practices, noting any mistakes and how we can improve on them. We’ll be using test prep tuesdays as a day to check our progress on improving each skill for the mc. 
12/8 tpt: reviewed mc#1 2018, and created our reflections for the test. 
12/15 tpt: review some skill sets that we need to improve on, as well as discuss journals, and how we can improve those as well. 

- Fridays: asynchronous learning/weekly submissions are due
On Fridays, we’ll be reviewing our progress on our coding and project, and reflecting on how the week progressed. We’re also going to be submitting our weekly assignments, as well as adding to the progress tracker and read me files. 
	12/11: our submission for today is our general outline and plan for what we want to get done and when. In the following week, our goal is to 
play around with the code
organize a plan for the coding itself
plan week by week if possible. We’re going to split the rooms on floor 1 most likely, and have maybe about 1-2 people working on a room. 
Finish planning out the puzzles and fully develop the puzzles by next week. 
Finish establishing the storyline next week. 
Include character data on each character, maybe incorporate CRUD from what we learned for the leaderboard and character data. 
	12/18: make sure we have a plan for the code, and continue coding. 

- Midterm: January 19-22
By midterm, our goal is to have at least one full floor coded. We’re going to have the floor include the puzzles, characters, and full developed storyline by this time. As we go week by week, we’re going to make any adjustments to this plan as needed, but for now, our goal will be to code at least one full floor - please see map. 

- N@TM: March 8-12
By n@tm our goal is to complete the full game, and make sure that it is playable, with no bugs or errors. If we have time before n@tm to add in more visuals, we’ll do so. 

- College Board AP Exam: May 13
By this time, the game will be fully coded and everything will be finalized.

<tr>
<th>Big Idea Number / Requirement</th>
<th>Big Idea Summary</th>
<th>Project Goal To Meet Each Requirement</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Big Idea #1</td>
<td>Creative Development: Collaboration, Design, Development, Function, Purpose, Resolving Errors</td>
<td>Working together as a team of 4 to come up with ideas and implement them. Collaboration between group and pair shares. Journals to keep track of progress. We're going to plan to use AGILE methods as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Big Idea #2 and #3:</td>
<td>Data, Algorithms and Programming: Using data, algorithms, and programming to create code.</td>
<td>Using SQLalchamey to create a database for our recipes and have the ability to add more recipes. Going beyond the Python fundamentals with logic and data. Using GET and POST, Python backend, and creating a data related UI. Having the ability to create, read, update, and delete recipes. We're going to include the CRUD method and SQL from the lecture from this week, as well as look into other ways to deploy and demonstrate the data.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Big Idea #3:</td>
<td>Algorithms and Programming: Using algos and programming to design and present to the user.</td>
<td>Creating a great UI desgin for our data filled website. Using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Making a visual storyboard before putting it into our website. We will have options for seeing data on leaderboards, as well as easy to access buttons for the user to understand. Furthermore, a nice immersive background and visuals to keep the user engaged.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Big Idea #4:</td>
<td>Computing Systems and Networks: How computing systems and networks function on the internet.</td>
<td>Deploying our website on a Raspberry Pi server, using HTTP protocol for communication, using GET to request data, and POST to update the data. We will use an internet router.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Big Idea #5:</td>
<td>Impact of Computing: The effects that computing can have and with our project.</td>
<td>Deploying our website onto the internet with a Raspberry Pi, sharing it to the community through Night At the Museum, and sharing it with College Board (AP Test). We're going to use integration here.</td>
