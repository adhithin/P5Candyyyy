# GAME OVERVIEW, as of friday, 2/19: 

**IDEA** 
We're now building an arcade. This arcade will include a variety of games, and each will also have a leaderboard that will log user's data through CRUD. 
Our games use API as well, and we're looking to create a fun interactive space for users to have fun.

Mini Code Review: 
- i finally got CRUD working! big thanks to Ms. Trish 
- i added in game 3 - a pokemon game

- finalized our new game plan and visualization 

Suggestions: 
- apply CRUD to other games 
- figure out how to incorparate read + delete (CRUD) 
- create stunning UI and visuals

# College Board Requirements & Big Ideas

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Big Idea Number / Requirement</th>
<th>Big Idea Summary</th>
<th>Project Goal To Meet Each Requirement</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Big Idea #1</td>
<td>Creative Development: Collaboration, Design, Development, Function, Purpose, Resolving Errors</td>
<td>Working together as a team of 4 to come up with ideas and implement them. Collaboration between group and pair shares. Journals to keep track of progress. We're going to plan to use AGILE methods as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Big Idea #2 and #3:</td>
<td>Data, Algorithms and Programming: Using data, algorithms, and programming to create code.</td>
<td>Using SQLalchamey to create a database for our recipes and have the ability to add more recipes. Going beyond the Python fundamentals with logic and data. Using GET and POST, Python backend, and creating a data related UI. Having the ability to create, read, update, and delete recipes. We're going to include the CRUD method and SQL from the lecture from this week, as well as look into other ways to deploy and demonstrate the data.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Big Idea #3:</td>
<td>Algorithms and Programming: Using algos and programming to design and present to the user.</td>
<td>Creating a great UI desgin for our data filled website. Using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Making a visual storyboard before putting it into our website. We will have options for seeing data on leaderboards, as well as easy to access buttons for the user to understand. Furthermore, a nice immersive background and visuals to keep the user engaged.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Big Idea #4:</td>
<td>Computing Systems and Networks: How computing systems and networks function on the internet.</td>
<td>Deploying our website on a Raspberry Pi server, using HTTP protocol for communication, using GET to request data, and POST to update the data. We will use an internet router.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Big Idea #5:</td>
<td>Impact of Computing: The effects that computing can have and with our project.</td>
<td>Deploying our website onto the internet with a Raspberry Pi, sharing it to the community through Night At the Museum, and sharing it with College Board (AP Test). We're going to use integration here.</td>
