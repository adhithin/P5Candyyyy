# Story
You’re a knight from the human realm that’s been held captive by the goblins. After being taken prisoner during the apocalypse, you’ve lost hope of ever seeing your friends again. 
One day, after a guard walks by, you hear the fall of an item. Your eyes shift to the sound. It’s a golden key. You pick it up and curiously fit the key in the lock of your cell. It unlocks the door, and you take a step outside. You let out a deep breath, and look both ways, then revel in your position. 
This is your chance to escape. Type “help” to start.
